# Due Task Helper
- License GNU.
## Functions
1. The concept is to add a place for due notes of 1 week at max of time to check.
2. After that take the body text from the notes and put on the  incomplete task note. (It is not a checker).
3. I recommend create a Note for the completed task inside the sub Root. And out side the Actives.
## Instructions.
1. On the settings: 
	- custom the folders and files names.
	- Set time duration on days for Task for the week. (Not actual week, it only add more time).
	- Create the files and directories by the custom command 'Create Directories' adding by the plugin.
2. Take notes and completed.
3. After the week note end It is disable. And need manual reactivation and set time.
## Finally.
- This plugin adds two comands: 'Toggle week durations due'. And 'Create Directories'. Reachable on the settings panel.
